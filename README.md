The Big Mountain Resort, a ski resort located in Montana, offers spectacular views of Glacier National Park and Flathead National Forest.  ~ 350,000 people ski or snowboard at Big Mountain each year. It has recently installed a chair lift, which increases the operating costs by $1,540,000 this season. The resort's executive team needs suggestions to develop a strategy to cover this cost, either by charging a premium fee, cutting underused facilities, or other scenarios. 
Given a data set including 277 peer ski resorts in the US, their facility features, and ticket price, the data science team, evaluated the market competitiveness for the Big Mountain resort, and developed practical pricing strategies to cover the increased cost using advanced machine learning algorithms.
